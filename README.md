# ONIS-News-React-Client

## Description

ONIS Solutions Code Challenge Client

-   A JavaScript application that shows the latest news world-wide, using the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) service.
-   It should be able to see the latest news. The user should have the ability to filter by keywords
-   If the user clicks on a news item it will navigate to a page displaying the full news article selected.

## Initial Configuration

Have **Node.js v16** installed. It is possible to install it from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/es/).
It is also wise to consider using [nvm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to manage different versions of Node.js for different projects.

Clone this repository (if you haven't done it already)

In the root directory of the repository, install the NPM dependencies:

```shell script
$ npm i
# with yarn
$ yarn
```

**IMPORTANT:** Before running the client, the [server](https://github.com/MrDanielG/ONIS-News-API.git) must be running to work correctly

If all the installation and configuration is valid, you will be able to launch the Node.js app without errors.

```shell script
$ npm start
# with yarn
$ yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to visualize the application
